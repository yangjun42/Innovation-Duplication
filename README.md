# VTT Innovation Resolution

This project addresses the challenge of identifying and consolidating innovation disclosures from VTT's collaboration partnerships.

## Challenge Description

The challenge focuses on two main tasks:

1. **Innovation Resolution**: Identify when different sources are discussing the same innovation by analyzing associated organizations, descriptions, and source text.

2. **Innovation Relationship**: Create a representation that aggregates information describing innovations without losing source attribution.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains two main sources:
- Company websites mentioning VTT collaborations
- VTT's website mentioning company collaborations

The data has been preprocessed into structured graph documents containing:
- Nodes (Organizations and Innovations)
- Relationships (DEVELOPED_BY and COLLABORATION)

## Setup

### Using pip

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


### API Keys

1. Obtain API keys for OpenAI models by asking at the VTT stand
2. Place your API key configuration in `data/keys/azure_config.json` with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "gpt-4o-mini": {
       "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
       "api_base": "YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT",
       "api_version": "API_VERSION",
       "deployment": "gpt-4o-mini",
       "eval_deployment": "gpt-4o-mini",
       "emb_deployment": "text-embedding-3-large"
     },
     "gpt-4.1-mini": {
       "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
       "api_base": "YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT",
       "api_version": "API_VERSION",
       "deployment": "gpt-4.1-mini",
       "eval_deployment": "gpt-4.1-mini",
       "emb_deployment": "text-embedding-3-large"
     },
     "gpt-4.1": {
       "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
       "api_base": "YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT", 
       "api_version": "API_VERSION",
       "deployment": "gpt-4.1",
       "eval_deployment": "gpt-4.1",
       "emb_deployment": "text-embedding-3-large"
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the introduction notebook to understand the data:
   ```
   jupyter notebook introduction_data.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the innovation resolution solution:
   ```
   python innovation_resolution.py
   ```

The script will perform the following steps:
1. Load and combine data from both company websites and VTT domain
2. Initialize OpenAI client for generating embeddings
3. Resolve innovation duplicates using semantic similarity
4. Create a consolidated knowledge graph
5. Analyze the innovation network
6. Visualize the results
7. Export the results to the `results/` directory
8. Run evaluation metrics on the results

### Command Line Options

The script supports various command line options for configuring the caching system and evaluation:

```
python innovation_resolution.py [options]

Options:
  --cache-type TYPE      Cache type to use (default: embedding)
  --cache-backend TYPE   Cache backend type (json or memory, default: json)
  --cache-path PATH      Path to cache file (default: ./embedding_vectors.json)
  --no-cache             Disable caching
  --skip-eval            Skip evaluation step
  --auto-label           Automatically label consistency samples and generate gold standard files
```

Examples:
```bash
# Use default configuration (JSON file caching)
python innovation_resolution.py

# Use in-memory caching (faster but not persistent)
python innovation_resolution.py --cache-backend memory

# Disable caching (regenerate embeddings each time)
python innovation_resolution.py --no-cache

# Custom cache file location
python innovation_resolution.py --cache-path "./data/cache/embeddings.json"

# Skip evaluation metrics
python innovation_resolution.py --skip-eval

# Use automatic labeling for evaluation (no manual labeling required)
python innovation_resolution.py --auto-label
```

## Solution Details

### Innovation Resolution

The solution uses semantic similarity through embeddings to identify when different sources are discussing the same innovation:

1. For each innovation, we create a feature representation combining:
   - Innovation name
   - Innovation description
   - Organizations that developed it

2. These features are converted to embeddings using OpenAI's embedding API or using TF-IDF as fallback

3. Cosine similarity is computed between all innovation pairs

4. Innovations with similarity above a threshold (default: 0.85) are considered duplicates

5. Duplicate innovations are mapped to a canonical innovation ID

### Caching System

The solution uses a modular caching system for embeddings to improve performance:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Abstract `CacheBackend` protocol for different backend implementations
   - `JsonFileCache`: Persistent file-based caching (default)
   - `MemoryCache`: Fast in-memory caching
   - `EmbeddingCache`: Unified front-end with configurable backend
   - `CacheFactory`: Factory for creating cache instances

2. **Features**:
   - Automatic embedding caching to avoid redundant API calls
   - Configurable cache backend (file-based or in-memory)
   - Option to disable caching completely
   - Automatic recovery from cache loading errors

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Designed to be easily extended with new cache backends
   - Compatible with both OpenAI embeddings and TF-IDF fallback

### Knowledge Graph Consolidation

Once duplicates are identified, we consolidate the knowledge graph:

1. All information about duplicate innovations is merged into a single representation
2. The consolidated graph maintains:
   - Multiple names for the same innovation
   - Multiple descriptions
   - All organizations involved in development
   - All source documents mentioning the innovation
   - Original IDs of the duplicate innovations

### Network Analysis

The solution analyzes the consolidated innovation network to extract insights:

1. Basic statistics about innovations and organizations
2. Identification of innovations mentioned in multiple sources
3. Key organizations based on network centrality
4. Visualization of the innovation network

### Evaluation Module

The solution includes a comprehensive evaluation module that assesses the quality of the innovation resolution process through four main components:

1. **Consistency Checking**:
   - Randomly samples merged innovations for human verification
   - Generates a CSV file with innovation IDs, aliases, and source snippets
   - Allows human labelers to mark whether the merged items are truly the same innovation
   - Calculates the overall consistency rate (percentage of correctly merged innovations)
   - With `--auto-label`, automatically labels samples using LLM or heuristic methods

2. **Entity & Relation Extraction Accuracy**:
   - Compares automatically extracted entities and relations against human-annotated gold standards
   - Calculates precision, recall, and F1 score for both entity and relation extraction
   - Requires gold standard files (`gold_entities.json` and `gold_relations.json`) in the `evaluation` directory
   - With `--auto-label`, automatically generates gold standard files by sampling from predictions

3. **Knowledge Graph Structure Metrics**:
   - Calculates comprehensive graph statistics including:
     - Node and edge counts by type
     - Average degree and graph density
     - Connected component analysis
     - Connectivity ratio

4. **End-to-End QA Testing**:
   - Performs sample queries on the knowledge graph, such as:
     - "Which organizations developed innovation X?"
     - "What innovations are associated with organization Y?"
   - Saves example query results for manual inspection

### Template Files for Evaluation

The repository includes template files in the `evaluation` directory to help users get started with the evaluation process:

1. **`gold_entities_template.json`**: 
   - Example format for gold standard entity annotations
   - Copy this file to `evaluation/gold_entities.json` and expand with your own annotations

2. **`gold_relations_template.json`**: 
   - Example format for gold standard relation annotations
   - Copy this file to `evaluation/gold_relations.json` and expand with your own annotations

3. **`consistency_sample_template.csv`**: 
   - Example of the consistency checking CSV with sample labels
   - Shows how to fill in the `human_label` column with "Yes" or "No"

4. **`qa_examples_template.json`**: 
   - Example of the QA testing results format
   - Shows the expected structure of innovation-organization relationships

To use these templates:

```bash
# For entity evaluation
cp evaluation/gold_entities_template.json evaluation/gold_entities.json
# Edit evaluation/gold_entities.json with your annotations

# For relation evaluation
cp evaluation/gold_relations_template.json evaluation/gold_relations.json
# Edit evaluation/gold_relations.json with your annotations

# For consistency checking (after first run generates the sample)
# Edit evaluation/consistency_sample.csv adding Yes/No in the human_label column
# Then run the script again to calculate consistency rate
```

To use the evaluation module, you can:

1. **Prepare Gold Standards** (optional):
   - Create `evaluation/gold_entities.json` with the format: `[{"name": "...", "type": "Innovation"}, ...]`
   - Create `evaluation/gold_relations.json` with the format: `[{"innovation": "...", "organization": "...", "relation": "DEVELOPED_BY"}, ...]`

2. **Run the Evaluation**:
   - Execute `python innovation_resolution.py` to run the complete pipeline with evaluation
   - For the first run, consistency checking samples will be generated
   - Fill in the `human_label` column in the generated CSV file
   - Run the script again to calculate the consistency rate

3. **Review Results**:
   - Evaluation metrics are printed to console during execution
   - Complete evaluation results are saved to `evaluation/evaluation_results.json`
   - QA examples are saved to `evaluation/qa_examples.json`
